This directory is used by the 'fortune' program to display custom quotes when we log into UNIX boxen.
Feel free to edit the .txt files to add quotes, or start a new .txt file if you'd like to create
a new category or grouping of quotes, sayings, maxims, or thoughts.  Each quote in the file
must be followed by a literal % on its own line, like this:

first quote
%
second quote
%
final quote

Finally, after editing the .txt file(s), run 'make' to generate the binary .dat file used
by fortune.
